# Hitman 2016 UI Conversion
A combination of Heritage UI, Hitman 2016 Menu and Music Replacement, Hitman 2016 Intro, and my own edits, aiming to make Hitman 3's UI look as close to Hitman 2016 as possible.

## What I've added/changed
- Objective icons and detection arrows are colored again, which isn't completely accurate to H2016, but I like it this way.
- Removed every Heritage UI customization option that isn't related to H2016.
- All objective icons have been rounded.
- Selected menu tiles have a white outline around them instead of a bar at the bottom, and the drop shadow has been added back.
- The target icon on the HUD, the one on the map, the intel icon, and the escape icon have been replaced with their respective ones from H2016.
- Added the dotted square on the minimap for when you're trespassing. (It is a bit translucent, but I don't exactly know how to fix that.)
- Trespassing, compromised, and unconscious witness icons are now arrows.
- Replaced the menu tile icons for some things (e.g. the career page, the load game button) with the ones from H2016.
- Changed the illegal item/action icon to the one from H2016.
- (Off by default) Changed a bunch of the guns' names to be more consistent with each other.

If you see anything in this changelog that you don't like, there's probably an option to turn it off in the SMF mod config page.

## Credits
[Burn, The Witch](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/121153618), for making Heritage UI, granting me permission to modify it, and indirectly teaching me so much about modding Hitman. You can really learn a lot by reverse-engineering and modifying someone else's mod.

[beneddyguitar](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/42615100), for making the Hitman 2016 Menu and Music mod, and [PandoraAlisu](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/162730918) for making it work with newer versions.

And all the people in Heritage UI's credits. I literally couldn't have done it without you.

Before you ask, I don't have to credit anyone for Hitman 2016 Intro, because that mod was also created by me.
