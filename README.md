# Heritage UI (EpicGaming11195 Edit)
My edited version of Heritage UI, made to look as close to Hitman 2016 GOTY as my modding skills allow.

## What I've added/changed
- Objective icons and detection arrows are colored again, which isn't completely accurate to H2016, but I like it this way.
- All objective icons have been rounded.
- Selected menu tiles have a white outline around them instead of a bar at the bottom, and the drop shadow has been added back.
- The target icon on the HUD, the one on the map, and the intel icon have been replaced with their respective ones from H2016.
- Trespassing, compromised, and unconscious witness icons are now arrows.
- Changed the boot video and menu music to the ones from H2016.
- Replaced the menu tile icons for some things (e.g. the career page, the load game button) with the ones from H2016.
- Changed the illegal item/action icon to the one from H2016.
- Moved the title screen logo up, so it's closer to the height it was at in H2016.
- (Off by default) Changed a bunch of the guns' names to be more consistent with each other.

If you see anything in that changelog that you don't like, there's probably an option to turn it off in the SMF mod config page.
