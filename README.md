# Hitman 2016 UI Conversion
A combination of Heritage UI, Hitman 2016 Menu and Music Replacement, Hitman 2016 Intro, and my own edits, aiming to make Hitman 3's UI look as close to Hitman 2016 as possible.

## What I've added/changed
- Added options to make objective icons and detection arrows colored again.
- Removed every Heritage UI customization option that isn't related to H2016.
- Added back the pause menu/inventory's background blur effect.
- All objective icons have been rounded.
- Selected menu tiles have a white outline around them instead of a bar at the bottom, and the drop shadow has been added back.
- Some menu tiles now have barcodes on their right side.
- Added a divider line near the bottom of menus.
- Added two menu and UI themes: one based on H2016 GOTY, and one based on the original H2016.
- The target icon on the HUD, the one on the map, the intel icon, and the escape icon have been replaced with their respective ones from H2016.
- Added the dotted square on the minimap for when you're trespassing. (It is a bit translucent, but I don't exactly know how to fix that.)
- Trespassing, compromised, and unconscious witness icons are now arrows.
- Replaced the menu tile thumbnails for some things (e.g. the career page, the load game button) with the ones from H2016.
- Changed the illegal item/action icon to the one from H2016, and repositioned it to the corner of the interaction circle.
- Removed the dot reticle shown when you're holding a gun but not aiming it.
- (Off by default) Changed a bunch of the items' names to be more consistent with each other.

If you see anything in this changelog that you don't like, there's probably an option to change it or turn it off in the SMF mod config page.

## Credits
[Burn, The Witch](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/121153618), for making Heritage UI, granting me permission to modify it, and indirectly teaching me so much about modding Hitman. You can really learn a lot by reverse-engineering and modifying someone else's mod.

[beneddyguitar](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/42615100), for making the Hitman 2016 Menu and Music mod, and [PandoraAlisu](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/162730918) for making it work with newer versions.

And all the people in Heritage UI's credits. I literally couldn't have done it without you.

Before you ask, I don't have to credit anyone for Hitman 2016 Intro, because that mod was also created by me.
